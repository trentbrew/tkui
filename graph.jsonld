      "description": "**Brandon:** One thought on the activity checkbox on release profiles... there needs to be visibility of that on the add product section, and the users need to be directed to answer related variable questions before the questionnaire in case that informs the threshold. That doesn't affect current clients, but if we get a utility, that's going to drive the whole thing **Tyler:** Hmm... Seems like maybe some of these chemical profiles should just be part of the product? Or maybe we somehow mark products as being associated with some emissions factors? **Brandon:** Yeah, my thought is if they mark manufactured as an activity type, they have to select either (a) compute using product concentration and activity, or (b) compute using a release profile. Hmm, I guess it's possible they could need a release profile for processing or otherwise use as well. What if the a and b options are just a toggle at the chemical level? **Tyler:** I'm not sure what it would mean to toggle between a release profile and a concentration at the chemical level **Brandon:** Meaning it would define how we compute the threshold contribution. If they select A, we do the same thing we always do (`activity * concentration`). If they select B, the amount is computed using the result of the release profile. The release is the threshold contribution. For example, when you emit pollutants from natural gas combustion, you are \"manufacturing\" those chemicals as a byproduct. So release = threshold contribution. **Tyler:** What are we gaining from going through a release profile versus just listing those chemicals as part of the product's chemical composition with the manufactured flag? **Brandon:** In my mind, we don't know what to count towards the threshold without a release profile. Am I missing something? **Tyler:** Maybe I'm overly stuck on the ones I'm familiar with - but most of what I've seen for fuels amounts to `amount used * EF` - there might be some unit conversions in there, but we could do those ahead of time. **Brandon:** So I think we solve a few problems. First, fuels are both otherwise used and manufactured. Right now, we have to create two products to capture that with different concentrations (one based on the actual concentration and one based on the concentration emitted). If we can set that on the product profile, we can avoid that duplication. Emissions factors can and will change from year to year, particularly for utilities who test every year, and I think the system is better equipped to handle change at the release profile/questionnaire level (although we could change that). Third, for Tier II, we'll always want to know the concentration in the product, so if we start just putting the emissions factor on the product, we'll have to go back and fill those in. Finally, for other non-fuel processes, especially for chemical manufacturing, I can imagine some very complex manufacturing release profiles that'd need to be accounted for. **Tyler:** Ugh **Brandon:** You've been spoiled with a very straightforward industry so far... haha **Tyler:** Part of what I'm trying to balance is keeping this all fast and easy to reason about - right now we're able to offload all of our threshold calculations to the DB, and it's very fast and relatively simple. If we start having to loop back through release profiles, everything is going to get slower, and we'll have to rework a bunch of stuff. It sounds like the complexity is going to be unavoidable **Brandon:** I am in favor of avoiding that and not making it slow. Open to other ideas **Tyler:** > I can imagine some very complex manufacturing release profiles that'd need to be accounted for. I think this in particular ruins any of the ideas I've had so far This may be too much in the technical weeds, but... I think we'll need some sort of \"threshold profiles\" or \"threshold formulas\" concept - or else we'll get stuck in weird loops where a chemical is not relevant to the questionnaire because we don't have the data we need and so the necessary questions are never displayed... We can probably precompute and cache the slow bits of thresholds and then proceed as we do currently, so maybe it won't be _too_ bad. In any case, I'm going to stop fretting and just throw this discussion into a trello card And when you sign with that utility we can figure it out",

Each week, facility users indicate whether there have been any updates on large (>$50 million) projects, or whether any new projects have been started via an ECMS Task. 2. New projects require documents to be uploaded which are handed off to Corporate for speccing out. Corporate needs to be able to list the relevant specs (equipment, building, or other unit; parameter; value), and relevant approvers (corporate environmental, facility environmental, facility project management, etc.) 3. Existing projects list a review of project specs, where changes to specs can be entered, or notes can be added. 4. Additional specs can be proposed, and those require unanimous consent from a list of approvers, handled as a separate ECMS task. 5. Finally, there would be a central project listing page where people could view the details on ongoing projects.

      "description": "The problem: Stormwater sampling produces an overall TSS value, and a small number of targeted chemical TSS values. This means you won't necessarily have specific numbers for all relevant chemicals, and that's fine. But it doesn't quite fit our current model of \"all chemical-specific TSS or only overall TSS\" - we basically force you to have two release profiles. It would be nice if we didn't force them into that. Example, Madera: [https://tri.envirotoolkit.com/2024/facility/73-madera--enclosures/release-profiles#5.3](https://tri.envirotoolkit.com/2024/facility/73-madera--enclosures/release-profiles#5.3 \"smartCard-inline\") It’s a little weird because they ended up _not_ reporting Nitrates this year, but they did the year prior, and we want things to automatically react properly. ‌ Some ideas: 1.

      "description": "Badly pasted teams conversation transcript: B: Basically, we need a standard approach to providing guidance. I am thinking some icon that appears anywhere we anticipate the user having questions. It could activate a sheet with the relevant content. T: Yeah that makes total sense - some sort of common component we can just drop in wherever we need it B: Exactly. Making a UI to define the guidance feels like too much. But hardcoding it in the code feels too difficult to maintain. Is there a middle ground? T: Off the top of my head I think we could make a new component like that you'd use like: `<Guidance title=\"Form R is hard\" guidance=\"Read several hundred pages of EPA guidance in order to understand this section...\" />` And this would render a link or tooltip or _something_ that users could click on. If the guidance text gets too long and obscures the page, I think we just extract the text to another file and do: ```javascript import { formRIsHard } from '@/guidance'; //... <Guidance title=\"Form R is hard\" :guidance=\"formRIsHard\" /> ``` Unless you're saying you think a separate file is still too much? We could put it in the database I guess, but we'd still have to pick the right places to put the link, so it feels like it belongs in the code to me. B: Fair enough. I guess if we just have a folder in the code structure dedicated to guidance topics, that's good enough. We'd probably want to store those as JSON or HTML files so we can enforce a little formatting? T: Yeah I lean towards a folder with HTML in it if we want to add formatting - Since we're using Vite we can import the content of HTML files into javascript, so the import line in my example above would change to something like: ```javascript import formRIsHard from \"@/guidance/form-r-is-hard.html?raw\"; ``` B: love it",

Corporate wants to be able to do an initial review of each of those and mark the ones where tasks are \"Not Needed.\" I suggested we could do that by adding all of the general permits to the Nucor Corporate permit list, but I think we'll need a bit more of an interface dedicated to that purpose. The basic workflow is this: 1. Whenever a general permit gets re-issued (generally every 5 years), corporate needs to be prompted to review the indexed result. 2. Corporate then identifies all items that are either \"Not Needed\" for task association or are otherwise inapplicable to Nucor facilities. 3. Corporate then publishes those to be available to the affected facilities, with the conditions they've excluded removed from review for the facilities. 4. I don't think we currently identify \"General Permits,\" so we may need to give some thought to that as well. 2. There are some permits that are notoriously bad at saying what they mean, largely because they incorporate rules without saying what they are. Here's an example below. The only thought I have is we can include a web search tool call in the AI result for states that are known to do this and try to synthesize what those rules require. Texas is the worst offender. Do you have any other ideas? Not sure if Gemini offers this out of box, but OpenAI does.",

Then go to the Queue page [http://localhost:3000/queue?facilities=l95rmupi_24cuop2vkzt](http://localhost:3000/queue?facilities=l95rmupi_24cuop2vkzt \"‌\") and click “Sync notifications”: ![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/68f2b90d2aaae9cc58855695/attachments/6917605252f8e4933e6e36be/download/image.png) This will cause your local system to process daily digest events. No real emails will be sent. You can view the emails that would’ve been sent in production by going to [http://localhost:8025/](http://localhost:8025/ \"‌\") and viewing an email. The table you are modifying looks like this: ![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/68f2b90d2aaae9cc58855695/attachments/69176097f50131302b358da7/download/image.png)",

      "description": "From Brandon: Like I mentioned, I did not mess with any backend functionality with my changes, so there are a few UIs that don't do anything yet. I think most if not all of these are already on our list, but I wanted to flag them: 1. Activity 1. I have an initial UI for units on the activity page that appears below the input for adding usage. I did not attempt to wire this up. Above my pay grade! All I am communicating with that is where I think the picker could live. Open to other ideas. 2. I added an \"Add Notes\" UI available under the actions button. I did not wire this up. 3. I added a flag when usage has a big swing that populates a sheet. I did not wire this up. 2. Assign release profiles 1. When a user clicks \"No release for x\", I added a UI to select 0 v NA, but nothing is wired up. I may tweak the UI a bit still before you wire it up. 3. Final Review 1. I added a button for each item under validation and issues to allow the user to go to the issue. Right now, it just generally links to a page, but I think we should get it down to the question level. 4. Registration 1. I have a UI for registration on the login page, but it doesn't actually work at the moment. I tried for a minute, but I think there are some config things on FB that need to be set up still? A few items I am still hoping to get to before you are able to transition to TRI: 1. Products 1. Route the manual entry/sds upload/bulk cards to the appropriate tab. 2. A few of the icons are placeholders. Hoping to refine a few of those. 3. The progress circle does not update in real time yet. 4. Hoping to make a few adjustments to some of our admin pages to better match some of the changes on the workflow side (table headers, icons, etc.) And two more things: - the edited by column on activity is just placeholder data. - There is a weird lead entry (0007439-92-1)",

For vendor audits scheduled not by corporate, they don't want the tasks in ECMS tracked and they want a statement in the description of the task that clarifies it is voluntary. 2. They want badges throughout cards on vendor audits for scheduled audits that clarify whether it is a required audit scheduled by corporate or a voluntary one scheduled by facility. Use \"Tracked\" and \"Untracked\" as designations. 3. For voluntary audits scheduled by facilities, they want the task to be due 12 months from the day it is scheduled. 4. ~~For tracked audits, they likely want to prevent users from moving the due date on ECMS but have not confirmed.~~ After some clarification: 1. Scrap audits should remain absent from ECMS. 2. It should once again be possible for facilities to schedule voluntary waste audits, and we need to mark them as such somehow at scheduling time. 3. They ultimately decided it’s okay for people to adjust dates on the ECMS tasks.",

      "description": "**Tasks:** - New Permit Tool UI within ECMS: - [1h] Allow permits to be marked as not needing to be indexed, recording a reason why. - [5h] Use AI to do an initial extraction of emissions units mentioned in the permit. - [0.5h] Allow users to manually add/remove/rename relevant emissions units, if any. - [5h] Use AI to do an initial page-by-page extraction of requirements/conditions laid out by the permit. - [4h] UI that allows users to walk through the permit page-by-page and identify conditions mentioned on each page. - [4h] Final review step wherein the user can: - Adjust the ID, description, type, and page number(s) of each condition - Tie each condition back to an existing ECMS task (or mark the condition as needing a task or not requiring a task) - [6h] Test with real permits and iterate on the UI and AI to try to make it as easy to use as possible. - [4h] Page where facilities can see all permits and whether or not they've been indexed yet. - Will need a readonly UI where users can view conditions for already-indexed permits, allowing them to open the source page in the permit. - [1h] New ECMS suggested tasks for indexing unindexed permits. - [2h] New ECMS suggested tasks for conditions identified as needing ECMS tasks. - When scheduled, these tasks should be linked in the Permit Tool on the appropriate condition. - [1h] When viewing a task linked to a condition in the Permit Tool, show a link in the Task Details modal to the relevant page of the permit. - [2h] Do an initial scan through of all our existing permit documents to see if there are any we can de-dupe before people start indexing. - Workflow for re-indexing permits on renewal. - [1h] Initial pdfjs-based diff to get a rough percentage of changes. If it is very low (<1%?) we can likely show the diff and recommend carrying forward the prior permit's conditions almost entirely as-is. - [2h] See if we can use AI to give us a sensible summary of any differences. - [6h] UI to allow users to walk through both old and new permit side-by-side while confirming/editing existing conditions and adding new ones. **Background:** - Nucor has lots of permits, and it is not clear if they have sufficient coverage over all the terms of the permit. - So, they want a tool that helps people go through permits and identify all all requirements/conditions and tasks that the permit entails. - Similar in spirit to the limit snipper tool, and tangentially related to AppTool. - Workflow (roughly): - New permit -> New ECMS task to index your permit. - Identify relevant emissions units - Air permits almost always have conditions tied to specific emissions units. - Other types of permits (i.e. Stormwater) may just apply to the whole facility, rather than any specific unit. - Page by page, identify the requirements/conditions laid out by the permit. - Fields: - Field similar to ECMS's existing \"inspection type\" that identifies what the type of requirement is. - A plain-language description of the task/condition - Associated ECMS tasks (if they already exist) or \"not required\" or \"need tasks\" - Get AI to give us a first draft attempt of each page - Don't want to give too much at once, but requirements may span page boundaries. - Permits range from a handful of pages to 250+, so we could easily blow out the context window. - Once complete, want to be able jump from the collected tasks/conditions back to the source within the permit - Probably just need page #s, not the whole snipping process like we did with limits. - Permit conditions may have identifiers (i.e. 3A.j.g.a or something), but the full identifier might not be written out in the text (i.e. it could be built from a cascade of section headings) - Permits change periodically, and ideally we don't want to have to redo all work. - Could we compare PDFs and do some kind of text search? - Is there a prompt we could give to the AI to help with this? - The problem in general, I think, is that there is no guarantee that the new permit file will retain its shape. - Feed into suggested tasks if items need tasks but are not scheduled. - Need to be able to mark permit as \"not needing to be indexed\" - Might need to de-dupe some permits that were uploaded twice - Some CSI permits are insane with a big opaque lookup table of units. - Most facilities are winging it today - Some have hired HBC to index their permits. - Many audit findings are because facilities don't know their own permits. - Many conditions require on-the-ground knowledge to fully spec out (i.e. \"operate this boiler according to manufacturer's specs\" - only the facility knows what those are, what monitoring is available on the unit, etc.) so full automation is impossible. - Corporate hasn't yet stated how exactly they'll roll this out. Brandon expects they may give all facilities a year to sort through their existing permits. **Notes on “Draft Review”** Behind the scenes, this would be doing the same thing that we'll need to do when a permit is renewed—identify conditions that change, stay the same, etc. and present those to the user in a meaningful way. The use case for it is that, during a permit renewal process, you get the opportunity to review a draft of your permit and provide comment. This would be used during that period in an effort to catch changes in time to provide comment.",

Safety Tasks? - SCMS - Do we need new Task Categories or Inspection Types? - Yes, brainstorm/use AI to generate some new names for Safety. - See below for an attempt at this. - Does anything like \"Standard Task IDs\" exist on the safety side? - No - Do their file uploads go to the same Sharepoint? Do we need a new folder? Or do we need to bring back Firebase uploads for the Safety branch? - Sharepoint. - Drive ID: `b!5O0W2T6zRUSm8rmxw7s-sbcseMD4c1dPp-jkbYHDjlo5BJuHZJc_RLxgTcEFU2za` - Root Folder ID: `01IPVYGQZFW3T5TZUZSNA36ETMBEZNXQZ2` - Does Safety want to handle escalation in the same way? - There is no David Miracle equivalent, that spot in the hierarchy can remain blank. - GM will be shared with Environmental. - Will need new Safety Manager role. - Emails will come from [ecms.notification@nucor.com](mailto:ecms.notification@nucor.com \"‌\") - will this bother anyone?

I'll eventually deploy the work I did for this on TRI toolkit side which will inform this. > > But can you get the project and infrastructure setup for adding a new section on nucor.report for this? Perhaps a new FB project? We may want to schedule a call to go over all that this will entail. Notes from meeting 2025-07-30: - TRI data Brandon organized not yet uploaded anywhere. - He sent me a spreadsheet with some info (attached to this item) - Also can just pull the EPA Q&A data from Wix or from the EPA's page as well. - The knowledge center will be more than just TRI - 4+ areas identified so far. - Likely best as its own app, as its expected to contain a decent amount and they want it to be the one canonical place Nucor people can go for various memos/answers. - Want to have vector search of some kind - Leaning towards an Azure solution if we need to, so Nucor will pay for it directly. - Otherwise leaning towards app-specific OpenAI tokens. - Also open to Algolia or other options, just need to do the research. - Organizational structure: - Categories - Subcategories - Affected facilities - Affected groups - Configurable in UI - Admins will need to do edits manually, though the initial data will be bulk inserted. - Ideally this app will be the future of legal advice at Nucor so that they can easily find all legal memos. - Largely plain text info, but want to be able to link to original source documents where appropriate.",

Ensure countries are clearly delineated (USA, Mexico, and Canada each have their own distinct vendor types, and admins working with each country are not necessarily aware of what the other types are)",

Because some groups report to the C-suite as different constellations. For example, NRFs might belong to a bar mill, so you need to aggregate reporting from Nucor Steel Seattle, and NRF A, and NRF B. --- Key points extracted from the issue text: **Overview** - Add a \"Reporting Groups\" feature to the KPI report page that allows users to create custom groupings of facilities for enhanced reporting and analysis. - This feature should be distinct from existing facility groups in the system. **Key User Flows** - Create Group: User clicks group+ button → modal opens → fills form → submits → group appears in real-time - View Groups: User selects \"Groups Only\" from dropdown → table shows aggregated group statistics - Export Groups: User selects group view mode → clicks Export → gets Excel with group data - Edit Group: User opens group management → edits existing group → changes appear in real-time **Acceptance Criteria** - Users can create, edit, and delete reporting groups - Groups persist in Firestore database with real-time sync - KPI table supports three view modes (facilities, groups, both) - Group statistics are properly aggregated from facility data - Excel export works for all view modes - Feature works with both single and multi-facility selections",

There are 3-4 Microsoft groups for environmental people - [3h] Monitor these groups periodically. - [2h] Create accounts in nucor.report universe and send email with access instructions (see attached nucor-welcome-email.docx) - [3h] We need some UI for mapping the facility names used by their systems, to the names/ids used by ours - likely a new facility field. - Will be facility engineers and managers, so will need to slice the permissions differently. - If we can’t identify a facility for a non-admin user, we likely need to reach out to an existing admin to fix up the mapping, or to add the new facility to our systems. - Add new users to NEU automatically. 2. Offboarding - [3h] Pull the list of users from Nucor AD and find users in nucor.report who don't have a valid Azure account. (according to Chunxin Tang, we can restrict search to the 4 groups listed below, but we should verify this is valid before executing against it) - [1] Deactivate their account. - [3h] Evaluate remaining ECMS tasks - reassign to facility manager. --- - Product and Raw Material ENV: 0e1f1262-c92a-429b-a0d0-f29245359efe - Steel Mill ENV: c767bac2-4339-44dd-8b89-ee70b7ac730b - Corp ENV-Corporate-Internal: 6f92cea6-c316-49f3-8da3-eca2057dc837 - Corp ENV-Managers: 70d02d4f-77ac-4e23-8a83-559676001b90 The first two would be general user permissions.

There should be an attribute within Microsoft Graph API that stores the facility information, which we can use to automatically map new teammates to their respective facilities in **nucor.report**. 2. **Welcome Email for New Users:** (Chunxin Tang will draft email) Once a teammate is added to **Nucor. Report**, we’d like to send them a **welcome email** explaining: - The purpose of the system - Key contacts for questions or support Would it be possible to automate this as part of the onboarding workflow? **Offboarding:** 1. **Task Reassignment for Terminated Teammates:** We previously discussed reassigning tasks to the **environmental manager** of a terminated teammate. However, in some cases, the manager may not be in **nucor.report**. I propose the following logic for reassignment: - **If the environmental manager is in Nucor. Report** → Assign tasks to them. - **If no Environmental Manager exists** → Another approach is we could assign it to all existing nucor.report users at that facility. I think that maximizes the likelihood that it will have the necessary visibility. - **If we can’t find anyone in the above category, assign to** Chunxin Tang. - Path chosen: - If no env. manager role exists, create one according to the rules above. - Reassigned owned tasks to env. manager role. - Don’t reassign NEU nor self-assessment tasks. - Remove offboarded person from involved on relevant tasks. - Remove offboarded person from roles. - If the role would be empty, follow the rules above. --- Additional offboarding notes: - Backfill Sharepoint IDs on all existing users. - Ensure Sharepoint IDs are added to new users (both automatically onboarded and manually added) - Then, automated offboarding will only look at users with Sharepoint IDs on them. - We'll pull a one-off list of users without sharepoint IDs who should've been offboarded already, and remove them manually after running by Nucor. - For safety, offboarding will only remove at most 10 users at a time. - For safety, offboarding will use a two phase approach: - On Monday, we'll identify and flag users to be deleted, and send a summary to Nucor. - On Friday, we'll delete those flagged users if we still cannot find them in Sharepoint. - Admins will be able to mark a flagged user as not eligible for deletion during the above period, which should request details on why and trigger and email to Michael and Tyler in case we need to update any logic.",

Elemental metals and metal compounds are tracked and reported separately under TRI. 2. _But_, metal compounds only need to report the weight of the parent metal for releases. 3. To support this, we currently support product chemical concentration conversions based on the lowest-weight oxide, which should represent a worst-case. 4. Long-term, we'd like to pull chemical formulas from PubChem to make adjustments more accurate to specific metal compounds. But for situations where the exact compound is unknown, the adjustment mentioned above is the best we can do. 5. Skyline historically has been conflating metal compounds and elemental metals as one in the same, without performing any sort of adjustment. 6. For now, we will update all Skyline chemical profiles to list elemental metals instead of metal compounds, as this keeps consistency with what they've done up to this point. 7. For future years, we may need to revisit Skyline to properly identify what is truly elemental vs. compound. Notes from Brandon that I was replying to: The issue would potentially arise any time a metal compound appears in a chemical profile . There's not a specific rule here other than this: > **2024 QA Consolidation #206. Do we count the nonmetal portion of metal compounds?** > > The nonmetal portion of metal compounds is included in threshold determinations but not in release and other waste management calculations. A user could do two things with this. If they know the compound, they could select the specific chemical compound in the chemical profile (or the product concentration). To properly account for an associated release, we'd need to make a molar adjustment to isolate the elemental metal portion of that compound. That means that, every time a new compound within the category is detected, we need to be able to determine the elemental portion. We could compute this, although this would need to be robust, probably something along these lines: 1. Use pubchem or another API to look up chemical formula based on CAS 2. Determine total molar mass by referencing atomic weight of each chemical 3. Determine elemental fraction in compound Rather than selecting a specific chemical, a user could also select the metal compound category. The app should interpret this as the user saying: I know there's a compound here, but I don't know what the compound is. Here, as with so many things in TRI, we have to make an assumption, and EPA likes those assumptions to have a bias for higher releases. The most conservative that could be made here is to select the lightest compound physically possible in the category. ERM has given us a few of those I believe. We'd have to look up the others. For expediency, I think the patch I've largely already implemented is good enough for this year. I've just gone through and changed the relevant compounds to the elemental form in the chemical profiles. Frankly, I think the prior consultants should've done that in the first place. That's how they were using it (i.e., they are not making any molar adjustments). So for now, let's just change all of the compounds in skyline's chemical profiles to the elemental form and put the other solution on the backburner (if that solutions makes sense to you).",

      "description": "EPA guidance: > 2024 QA Consolidation #8. How are toxic chemical categories handled under Section 313 threshold determinations and release and other waste management calculations? > All toxic chemicals in the category that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used at a covered facility must be totaled and compared to the appropriate thresholds (40 CFR Section 372.25(d)). A threshold determination for toxic chemical categories is based on the total weight of the compound. Except for metal compound categories and nitrate compounds, the total weight of the compound released or otherwise managed as waste must be reported. Releases and other waste management quantities of metal compounds are only required to account for the weight of the parent metal. Any contribution to the mass attributable to other portions of each compound in the category is excluded. (40 CFR Section 372.25(h)). If the metal and corresponding metal compounds exceed thresholds, a joint report for metal compounds, including the parent metal, can cover both reporting requirements. Similarly, releases and other waste management quantities of nitrate compounds are reported as the nitrate portion of the compound. EPA guidance elsewhere \"Lowest weight oxide form of the compound\" --- Need to be careful here: 1. Thresholds still need to report the whole compounds. 2. Releases just need to report the parent metal. 3. Therefore, applying the adjustment at the product-level (as was my initial thought) may be misguided. 4. Applying it at the release profile chemical profile level seems fine though (it is _releases_) after all.",

      "description": "Product inputs have new units fields for capturing things like MMBtu vs. pounds vs gallons. This should play nicely with our existing data source-based unit conversion mechanism. It’s unclear _exactly_ how they should interact, as units really feel like a property of the _raw usage_, not a property of the product - are they just the default units for manual/excel uploaded usage? (otherwise editing how you record a product would cause the system to re-interpret all past usage: that seems bad!) --- It’s important to note that manual/excel-uploaded has all been coming in directly to `productUsage` under `dataSourceImportID` `1`, which is named `Test` - none of this is going through `productUsageRaw`, which is at odds with how the system was designed (it should be possible to blow away `productUsage` and re-create it from `productUsageRaw` at will so we can process new product and units mappings, but these manual uploads make it so this properly is lost) --- Notes from conversation with Brandon on 2025-04-18: - Brandon has greatly simplified manual usage entry. - Ensure we record who is entering data manually. - Brandon agrees product usage units is likely more a default for manual usage entry rather than a true property of the product. - We'd like to move towards manual usage units being more freeform in general (i.e. with users able to specify convertible mass units or even interact with the units conversion table, similar to release profiles) --- When we get around to usage units issues, here's a good example to test that it's working: ![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/67c9ee66173100ceb9be9308/attachments/6806c670c19039d3b68bf440/download/image.png) This is at about a 10th of what it should be since it's treating gallons as pounds.",

Additionally, we still need to: - Add release profile toggle that has a question which switches between formulas (used for, for example, picking the most specific TSS values) - Show values from prior years for comparison purposes. - Add \"copy answer from last year\" button. - Copy the release profile assignments from 2023 to 2024. - Add basis of estimate to the release profile. These are also necessary, but are pending on updates from Oldcastle: - Get the appropriate facility personnel into the system. - Import 2024 usage data so we have thresholds to work with. My plan of attack is roughly: - Tackle everything that changes the structure of the questionnaire (splitting up numbers by vendor, qualitative question, swapping formulas based on answer, copying answers from prior year) - Flesh out all remaining form R fields we'll still need. - Copy across release profiles - Run an initial 2024 import if doable quickly, or use 2023 numbers as placeholders. - At this point we should have a questionnaire we can send, assuming they've gotten us a list of people who need to answer it. - Circle back to remaining items (basis of estimate, making previous year form R data available for use, etc.) I'm not sure on an exact timeline here (hopefully we don't find anymore curveballs), but I think I should be able to complete the top 3 items above by the end of this week or early next week, which should get us pretty close to having a usable questionnaire.",

(for use in comparison reports) - Report - Year-over-year comparison for each chemical. - Table with raw data and various filters. --- Fields to collect: - Manufacturing, processing, and otherwise use threshold results. - If the chemical exceeds threshold, the following releases: - 5.1 Fugitive emissions - 5.2 Stack Emissions - 5.3 Discharges to Streams - 6.1 Discharges to POTW - 8.1c Off-site Landfills - 8.5 Recycled offsite - 8.6 Treated on-site - 8.7 treated offsite See: [https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/guideme\\_ext/guideme\\_ext/guideme/file/ry\\_2023\\_form_r.pdf](https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/guideme_ext/guideme_ext/guideme/file/ry_2023_form_r.pdf \"‌\") [https://guideme.epa.gov/ords/guideme\\_ext/guideme\\_ext/guideme/file/ry\\_2023\\_rfi.pdf](https://guideme.epa.gov/ords/guideme_ext/guideme_ext/guideme/file/ry_2023_rfi.pdf \"‌\") ‌ --- TRI API: - [https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/metadata/api-viewer](https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/metadata/api-viewer \"smartCard-inline\") - [https://www.epa.gov/enviro/envirofacts-data-service-api](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/envirofacts-data-service-api \"smartCard-inline\") - [https://www.epa.gov/enviro/dmap-graphql-api](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/dmap-graphql-api \"smartCard-inline\") - tri.tab\\_v\\_tri\\_form\\_r\\_ez\\_pg may be the most relevant API for us. - Facility Search: [https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/tri/search](https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/tri/search \"smartCard-inline\") --- Notes from 2024-12-03: - Similar mechanism to KPI. - More refined reporting - Compare divisions and facilities - Compare facility to itself over time - Most (all?) of the data they want already gets reported to the EPA. - If possible, query the EPA for the TRI data. - For comparison between EPA-submitted and ECMS-reported data. - For backfilling of historical data. - Brandon played with the API a bit and couldn't get all the numbers they want, so this part may not be fully feasible.",

      "description": "**User reports:** No daily digest emails since Thursday (March 6th 2025) **High-level technical symptoms:** We have a backend queue that periodically processes things like emails, escalations, creating tasks from audit portals, etc. and that queue started having issues sending email on Thursday the 6th, and then became entirely stuck on Saturday the 8th. **Root cause:** This permit was marked as needing renewal in year 4, (as in 4 AD): [https://files.nucor.report/files/file\\_fes\\_file\\_m7xtqtbf\\_0xmjcpdybol/lag87000-ldeq-general-permit-for-pesticides?details=true](https://files.nucor.report/files/file_fes_file_m7xtqtbf_0xmjcpdybol/lag87000-ldeq-general-permit-for-pesticides?details=true \"‌\") The system wasn't expecting this, and got stuck in a loop trying to compute all the expected overdue notifications for the associated task: [https://ecms.nucor.report/task\\_m7xvez2k\\_17z7m9q6hpd](https://ecms.nucor.report/task_m7xvez2k_17z7m9q6hpd \"‌\") (it shows as due in 1904 due to an unrelated bug, but the date in the database really is 4 AD). **Resolution:** 1. The code that computes notifications will now use 1970-01-01 as the task due date if it receives a due date before 1970-01-01 (our oldest imported task is due in 2002, so this is overly generous, but it’s hard to pick a single correct cut-off date). 2. There is now a watchdog Cloud Run function that runs every 3 hours, and emails us if more than 10 queue tasks within 24 hours have not succeeded. 3. I temporarily made it possible for the backend to skip queued tasks, so that we could drain the backlog of 1000+ queued items quickly by skipping repeated/redundant queued tasks (i.e. we sync FES hourly, once we catch up once we’re good-to-go)",

I don’t see a field for these. - The more I think about this, the more I question whether this will give her any new/relevant information that she can't already get from sorting the existing table by date. I also don't think the existing table really aligns with this concept since each row may be a reflection of input provided over several different tasks. I am thinking we **just add a third table that has the latest task with each question, the person answering it, and a link to the task.** This is largely redundant, but I think it'll be more palatable than trying to convince her she doesn't need what she's asking for 🙂 - Is there a way to flag for us when there are updates to receiving a draft permit or preparing application? Perhaps highlight and send us an automated email on the 11th to alert us there are “yes” answers? - I am thinking we **just include this in the daily digest for the three individuals listed.** - At some point, we should propose a UI for them to manage all these special lists/roles at the corporate level.",

      "description": "- Government mandated report in 7 months. - Step 1: questionnaires/forms for data collection. - Release profiles that determine inputs and data collected by each facility. - How much of each input that gets used. - Concentration of chemicals in inputs - hardcoded or entered from data safety sheets. - Emissions factors - % of material that gets released - likely collected/hardcoded by Hiser Joy. - Facilities will be assigned release profiles. - Want to collect as much data as we can up front and then calculate as much as we can, possibly circling back but ideally we'd avoid that. - One big barrier today is product entry - users upload SDS files which need to be manually parsed into tables of chemical concentrations. - Brandon is extracting data via AI. - I think we might be able to just extract tables from PDFs if the PDFs are relatively well-formatted. - We will likely receive raw data from their purchasing system. - Reference huge spreadsheets he sent me previously. - A couple different ones are relevant. - Their existing system asks questions and asks for data uploads which are then reconciled by hand. - Existing system is here: [https://epcrat2.erm.com/PortalHm.html](https://epcrat2.erm.com/PortalHm.html \"smartCard-inline\") - Chandler is a good reference facility. - We can somewhat correlate back between questions and the spreadsheets to see where this is all driving from/to. - Brandon set up a Teams space that contains the relevant spreadsheets. - 90% of facilities are in the Precast category. - Different uses will have different release profiles and emissions factors. - High-level overview of the system's purpose: - EPA sets thresholds for section 313 chemicals. - You look at your usage and aggregate what your maximum possible emissions could be. - You then do release reporting if you have exceeded the EPAs thresholds. - Release reporting entails looking at the amount you released and allocating it to various places (vendors, water, filters, etc.) - Releases can be for processing, manufacturing, and other usages. - We'll also need to give facilities a way to identify waste vendors (landfills, treatment plants) and other specific outputs (bodies of water) - Design: - Don't make it look like Nucor, but re-use code freely. - Find some sort of bootstrap template to base things on. Maybe this one: [https://demos.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-vue-argon-dashboard-pro/?_ga=2.60314223.37708207.1735332185-1191293925.1735332185#/dashboard](https://demos.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-vue-argon-dashboard-pro/?_ga=2.60314223.37708207.1735332185-1191293925.1735332185#/dashboard \"smartCard-inline\") - Build the app as multi-tenant. - See reference apps script that brandon built for some ideas on the featureset we're going for. - I think its this, but it doesn't run for me: [https://script.google.com/home/projects/1t_HC46mqqhxUXhk-u6J3PaBf2nfI8AKaw_By7-bCZmEGA038qRwbRJ7s/edit](https://script.google.com/home/projects/1t_HC46mqqhxUXhk-u6J3PaBf2nfI8AKaw_By7-bCZmEGA038qRwbRJ7s/edit \"smartCard-inline\") - Maybe I can try running it locally? (tbh it's likely just HTML and some relatively static data?) - Ideally we would capture equations and make them user-configurable so that Hiser Joy doesn't have to wait on developers, and so Oldcastle could potentially configure release profiles themselves.",

The table includes a button to allow you to assign a facility to the vendor. This does not create a task or officially assign the vendor. 5.

I think they are all good ideas, but I wanted to run them by you to see if this is something you all want to move forward with. The general theme is expanding the overview page to allow you to do more there. 1. [2h] Allow completion of the point of contact task on the overview page. 2. [2h] Include the vendor representative contacted during last audit, if any. 3. [2h] Add a subscription button on the table for new vendors. 1. On the By Vendor view. 4. [5h] Make audit editable when opened on overview page. 1. Brandon believes this should be as easy as toggling a boolean. 5. [3h] Include a map with all vendors and allow viewing scrap and waste vendors at the same time. 6. [1h] Update color coding on subscribers to make the facility responsible for the audit more clear. 1. Translation: Stop highlighting current facility and just highlight the auditing facility so there's no confusion about which is which.",

      "description": "- Primarily first, an estimate. This is for a would-be client we're trying to win a bid on (aka not for Nucor!) - EPA Toxic Release Inventory - EPA wants to know which chemicals on the list that you are releasing. - 3 thresholds for reporting: - Manufacturing - Processing - Otherwise used - Generally all chemicals have the same thresholds, but some especially toxic chemicals have their own thresholds. - At a high level: - Put in what you produced to an online UI we develop, we do some calculations. - We tell you what chemical emissions need to be reported to the EPA. - We ask some more questions, do more calculations. - We spit out EPA TRI XML files, which can be uploaded to the EPA to fulfill the reporting requirements. - See: [https://exchangenetwork.net/data-exchange/toxics-release-inventory-tri/](https://exchangenetwork.net/data-exchange/toxics-release-inventory-tri/ \"smartCard-inline\") - Example file: [https://www.exchangenetwork.net/schema/TRI/6/TRI\\_Example\\_Instance\\_Document\\_v6.2.xml](https://www.exchangenetwork.net/schema/TRI/6/TRI_Example_Instance_Document_v6.2.xml \"‌\") - The report is also known as \"Form R\". - Generally the EPA wants to know where you are releasing to, examples: - To water via storms. - POTW - Public treatment works - Air emissions - Waste - where did your waste products go? (landfill, recycling, etc.) - Reports are sent to EPA and sometimes states too. - EPA appears to share data with the states, not clear if we'll eventually need state-specific exports as well. - Very similar in spirit to the emissions app. - We will likely want Excel output in addition to the XML output. - Spreadsheet won't be the source of truth, but Brandon will be sending along spreadsheets for communication purposes. - Initial users are likely 3 people at corporate who have to produce these reports for 60-90 facilities. - Most facilities are highly similar, but have different mixes and processes. - Some outlier facilities exist that will have their own bespoke calculations. - Various concerns off the top of my head while thinking about estimate: - How should we handle year-to-year variations/history? - i.e. you tweak base material composition data in 2025. Do you ever want to re-pull 2024 data? If yes (simplest case would just be comparing year-over-year), do you expect the same results as you got in 2024? Or different results? - Probably depends on situation. - Year-over-year we'd want the same. - You might want to running simulations (i.e. we're thinking of changing suppliers... Let me enter in their numbers, and then re-run 2024 as if we had used them) you'd want to be able to use new numbers on old data. - We could make lots of things immutable, but then it's unclear how you pick between them. - You could always pick the latest during editing/report building, and then snapshot a high level view on export. - Are years even properly comparable/reusable? - Fundamental changes to processes could make comparisons misleading. - Brandon showed me a large number of sheets - We'll need some high-level way to specify tables/collections and calculations drawing from them all, because I don't want to implement 20+ table UIs and I'd rather our computations read more like declarative aggregations than be filled with manual iterations, joins, etc. - We'll need to make audit logging and data fetching stupid easy. - We might consider making this multi-tenant, though that may require overgeneralization of a problem we don't yet fully understand. - It's not clear if we want to keep the same deployment model. - It's also not clear how we would structure the DB (DB-per tenant? top-level collection per-tenant? tenant ID on all documents?) - Brandon wants an estimate sooner rather than later. - In addition to TRI-specific features, we'll need to include in that estimate: - Setup - Hosting - Auth - Facilities collection - User management - Some estimate of the burden of each calculation category required.",

      "description": "1. In KPI task, we want to clarify the wording of the stormwater **exceedances** params. 1. ~~Here, just add a small text note that says: \"Note that this was previously reported as parameters meeting benchmark. Ensure that you are reporting the number of parameters **exceeding** the benchmark.~~ 2. Actually, just bold the word exceedances in “Number of Benchmark Exceedances”. Also, if they mark N/A on “Number of Stormwater Parameters Monitored”, that would mean the “Number of Benchmark Exceedances” is also N/A. 2. Link inspection documents to the corporate SharePoint folder. 1. Here they are thinking they want all inspection files in one top-level folder with tags added for the facility and the type of document (e.g., a tag based on which question the item was uploaded to). 2. They use \"tags\" in their sharepoint environment, but I am not seeing a way to expose those in the API. Do you? If not, the next best thing we could do is columns, right? 3. Add export button for Facility List on Nucor.report. 1. They just want to be able to export to excel the list of facilities on the admin page with corresponding location data, group data, etc. 4. The updated memo did not apply to all the suggested tasks for facilities yet. 1. I'll have to take care of this one. 5. Possible export button for agenda visual. See attached for an example where we can export the tasks by occurrence frequencies. 1. Can you give me a quote on this one? The attached should give you a sense, but I think it's just a list of all tasks grouped by their recurrence interval.",

We would also like to print the scrap vendor audit checklist, since that may be more applicable. I am not able to schedule an audit with them in the Scrap Vendor audit portal. In fact, none of my subscribed scrap vendors show up in my list to schedule. While in Florida, Dennis would also like to audit the TMR facility on Dover Street in Tampa.

Only 2 new task series were scheduled in Nucor Steel Memphis this month, both of them for BOLCC. 3.

Do we join them or let them duplicate? 1. Join them if same, keep all if separate 3. If the facilities specified different time zones, who wins? 1. Should be minimal in terms of difference, but the surviving facility should win 4. To display folders quickly, we cache some of the folder hierarchy in Firestore, and this data ends up being a bit weird to merge... Though I did recently add an easy way to regenerate it, so this is moot now. 1. Call this regen function. 5. If we end up implementing custom enforcement action stages as we discussed previously, how should those be merged? 1. Probably not going to happen, so we can shelf this concern for now.",

The system is showing 2 tasks because she told it to, not because of the reschedule. 1. Because Vendor Audits don't have precise dates, we let users input any schedule they want (under the assumption that they'd want to pick the date of their visit, or the date they plan to submit the audit report, rather than always picking the last day of the quarter for them). 2. Rather than a task that is due once, she picked this schedule: \"Every 3 years, on day 31 of the month, 2 times, first due on 9/1/2024\" 3. And that's what you see in her screenshot: the initial task, and the 2nd one due 3 years later. 2. Because users choose the schedule, we don't perform any automatic schedule changes when changes happen in Vendor Audits. I see a couple possible paths forward here: 1. Restrict users to one-time tasks for vendor audits, to avoid this confusion. 2. Restrict users to one-time tasks due at the end of the quarter specified on the vendor audit, and then automatically update the due date based on changes in Vendor Audits.",

(i.e. a holiday calendar for a particular facility that gets applied to particular tasks) Or are the exclusions always specific to a particular task? - Re-using exclusions seems convenient, but also potentially allows spooky-action-at-a-distance (i.e. you remove an exclusion, a bunch of tasks get created, you add it back and they still persist) - Where do we store exclusions? (I'm tempted to store them separately from the task generator, because in theory they could be unboundedly long... (i.e. gaining a year's worth of holidays every year) But that creates a can of worms because I think the exclusions should be tied to the schedule... and now we need to fetch these exclusions everywhere) - Can only specific dates be excluded? Or can recurrence patterns be specified as well? (i.e. exclude every fourth Thursday in November for Thanksgiving) - For the UI, do we want to focus on showing task dates (i.e. a list of dates or a calendar) or do we just want to allow simple date entry? **Answered questions** - Can you exclude a date in the past? (I'm going with no: just delete the task you don't want) - How do exclusions interact with limits? (I'm going with: excluded dates don't count towards the limit) - Do we compensate for exclusions in any way? (i.e. skip a Friday holiday but schedule for that following Monday) (I'm going with no: too many edge cases, we'll just skip emitting that date for the task)",

      "title": "ECMS - KPIs and Enforcement Actions",
      "description": "High-level feature description from Brandon: 1. **Identify Enforcement Stages.** 1. We will begin by working with your team to identify enforcement stages. For example, these stages could include: 1. Government inspections 2. Inspection reports 3. Notices of violation 4. Response to Notice of Violation 5. Resolution 2. For each stage, we'll work with your team to identify the data desired for each stage. For example, the initial inspection stage may have the following prompts: 1. Provide the name of the agency or agencies conducting the inspection 2. Provide the name of the inspectors 3. Identify the subject matter area of the inspection 4. Were you provided notice of the inspection? If so, how? 5. Identify the Nucor teammates who participated in the inspection 6. Upload any checklists provided during or prior to the inspection 3. Variable stages 1. In practice, stages vary by jurisdiction and/or subject matter area. For example, Texas's air enforcement does not follow the same process as Illinois's water enforcement. 2. We can address this by abstracting stages to a point that they'll generally fit the trajectory of any enforcement matter or identify stages for different subject matter areas and/or jurisdictions. 2. **Scheduled Updates.** In ECMS, teammates' dashboards will be populated with a recurring monthly task where they'll be asked to report new enforcement matters or update existing enforcement matters. A facility would also be able to update an enforcement matter or create a new one at any time using the same interface. Teammates will be asked two questions: 1. Question 1: Have there been any new enforcement matters? 1. If they indicate yes, they'll be prompted to enter the data requested. 2. The amount and nature of data requested will depend on the stage of the enforcement. 2. Question 2: Have there been any developments in any of the existing enforcement matters listed below? 1. A list of enforcement matters already created in the system will appear and be available to select for updates. 2. The teammate will select the current stage of the enforcement matter and be prompted to provide the information for each stage that has occurred up to that point. 3. **Enforcement Summary** 1. The data reported through these tasks will be made available on a separate dashboard within Nucor.report. 2. Data visibility will be scoped to the users' permissions. For example, any one at the corporate office would see all facilities' enforcement matters, Adriana Saunders would see all of NIPG, etc. 3. Alerts and notifications could be developed as needed to prompt the corporate team of new information. Additional details: 1. As part of this item we will be tracking KPIs in addition to enforcement actions. 2. We’ll need to implement a new KPI task type/custom field type. 3. KPIs are numbers, recorded by each facility monthly. 4. Any number > 0 requires a comment to be supplied. 5. Example task with basic fields needed: [https://ecms-test.nucor.report/task\\_lx23k2n0\\_24e5q77npbt](https://ecms-test.nucor.report/task_lx23k2n0_24e5q77npbt \"‌\") 1. Title V Deviations 2. Non-Title V Deviations 3. Permit Exceedances 4. Violations (NOVs) 5. Penalties/Fines Total Costs 6. Number of Stormwater Parameters Monitored 7. Number of Benchmark Exceedances 8. ...and comments for each field above if non-zero. 9. Plus, task stats for DJJ/Raw Materials facilities (Total #, On-Time # per Tracked, Tracked Internally, Untracked) (they don’t use Aerie nor our ECMS, they use a different system) --- Brandon is hoping to have KPIs portion ready for testing by 6/25 so that we can have testing, review, and feedback for a couple weeks before the next KPI deadline on 7/10.",

If a task has custom fields, have a checkbox for each field that says \"Corrective Action Required?\" 2. They would then have the option to create a task with all corrective actions as a single task or separate tasks. 3. If it's not too hard, it'd be nice if they could group the CA items into any number of tasks (e.g., these two issues can be addressed at once, but this one will take longer and needs to be a separate task). 4. If a task has no custom fields, add a \"Complete with CA\" button. This should take them to a pared down task creation interface with the title filled out and sensible defaults. **From discussion between Tyler/Michael on 2024-01-15:** ``` correctiveActionFor?: { taskGeneratorID: TaskGenerator['taskGeneratorID']; customFields: CustomField['customFieldID'][]; } ``` Here is how we're handling each field for corrective actions: - Title - New (possibly generated) - Description - New (generated) - Task Category - Copied and hidden. - Task Inspection Type - Copied and hidden. - Owner - Copied and dislayed. - Involved - Copied and displayed. - Tracked status - Copied and displayed. - Standard task ID - Blank and hidden. - Folders - Blank and hidden. - Schedule - 1-time task, only show due date, hide recurrence and reminders/notifications. - Custom fields - Blank and hidden.",

I've confirmed that every 5% is sufficient, so we can ditch everything in between. Yay! 2. When you click start recording, let's have prominent heading that says: 1. Before beginning your observation, consider the following: 1. If you obtain a valid reading but fail to record it in time, you will have the opportunity to record this after the observation period is complete. 2. Per EPA guidance, if you fail to obtain a valid reading for a 15-second interval because it was difficult or impossible to obtain (e.g., plume was obscured by fugitive emissions, plume rolling, or an improper background\"), you may continue your observation. We'll simply disregard this interval in the averaging period and add an additional 15-second interval at the end. 3. Per EPA guidance, if you fail to obtain a valid reading for a 15-second interval due to distraction, eye strain, or another reason within your control, you will be required to start the test over. You can cancel the observation if this occurs. 2. Now, observe the plume momentarily and select your first reading to begin the observation. 3. Let's have a label that toggles: 1. Until a reading is selected: \"X seconds left to record your reading. Observe the plume momentarily and select your reading.\" 2. Once a reading is selected: \"X seconds until your next reading. You may change your reading if you selected X% by mistake.\" Naturally, allow them to adjust the reading until the interval is over. 3. If they fail to select a reading in time, on the bottom during the next 15-second interval, let's have a message that says: \"If you obtained a valid reading but did not record it during the last interval, you can add this value after the reading is complete.\" 4. With the new real estate, I'd like to make the timers more prominent and preferably across the top. 5. EPA is very particular about how missed readings are handled. Here's what we'll need to do. 1. Continue to place the dash as we are now. 2. When a reading is missed, they need to select one of three options: 1. \"I obtained a valid reading and can record it now.\" 1. If this option is selected, they should be required to enter the value to proceed. 2. \"I missed the reading because it was difficult or impossible to obtain (e.g., plume was obscured by fugitive emissions, plume rolling, or an improper background\") 1. If this option is selected: \"Good news! EPA allows you to disregard this time lapse in the averaging period. Please enter a comment to explain the difficulty encountered.\" 3. \"I missed the reading due to eye strain, distraction, or another reason within my control.\" 1. If this option is selected: \"EPA guidance requires this observation to be discarded. This will remove the observation and require you to conduct the observation again. Would you like to proceed?\"",

      "description": "From Brandon: 1. At the end of the assessment, users are asked if they'd recommend the vendor. 1. If anyone answers no, that should appear on the corporate dashboard for the corporate team (“corporate team” meaning: Anyone with Nucor corporate as their organization location, or anyone with access across Nucor.) This dashboard item will link users to the audit that was performed on that vendor. 2. It should appear in the subscribed facilities box as well as the corporate team's. 3. The corporate team should have the ability to resolve the issue based on new information. A simple \"Remove this flag\" and a box for an explanation can be provided. This would remove the flag from all facilities. 4. An alternate option like “Yes, we agree we should stop using this vendor” would clear the dashboard item and record agreement from corporate. 5. When an audit is completed with this answer, the affected facilities should receive notification of this. (this would be the “wastecontacts” and “scrapcontacts” - verify those are populated for every facility that has participated in vendor audits. If we’re somehow missing some, then we might need to fall back to permissions to find people to email) 2. Can we add to the card of each vendor throughout the system the average score they've received on audits? They are given a 1-10 rating at the end. 3. If the \"would you recommend\" question is answered no, let's put a flag on that vendor card in the vendor audit system as well. It can just be a red warning icon that, if clicked, will say: \"X facility conducted an audit on X and recommended Nucor no longer use this vendor.\"",

Store Firebase Storage path rather than download URL. - Permission-checked download URLs like [https://ecms.nucor.report/download/{fileID}](https://ecms.nucor.report/download/%7BfileID%7D \"‌\") - Medium term future, if we add this feature: Short lived signed URLs for file previewing through third party components, same as Nucor Files. See: EcmsFile in `common/types/ecms.ts` **Folder Handling** From Brandon: 1. A way to organize the custom field completion items. When adding custom fields, there should be an option to select a folder where these inspections should be stored. 2. There should be a folder at the top level of our file system called ECMS. The folder specified on the task is then a sub folder within that. The idea is that when completed, they can go back and retrieve the inspection at a predictable place. 3. The ECMS app should have a top level menu item called folders. This is basically the ECMS folder subcollection. 4. Within each folder specified, there should be a way to view each inspection completed and generate an exported file to download. From Tyler: 1. Let’s make it so tasks (or more likely TaskGenerators and TaskTemplates) can be grouped into folders. 2. We’ll need to take some care in ensuring that updates to categorization get pushed out appropriately. High level steps: - [4h] Folder selection UI within custom tasks. - [4h] Toplevel folder browsing page. (borrow UI heavily from Nucor Files?) - [4h] Ability to view and download the task custom field answers. **Inspection Types** - Calibration - Fee - Inspection - Monitoring - New Permit - Notification - Other - Permit Renewal - Plan - Registration - Report - Testing - Training - Update/Review **Categories** - Air - Corp - DOT - EMS - EPCRA - Maintenance - Other - Radiation - SPCC - Waste - Water **Daily Email Digest** I think a task that is tracked and overdue needs an immediate email when completed (since presumably people are worried about it). Otherwise everything else I can think of could fit within a daily digest. Here's a list of emails we send currently: 1. Task is created. (can be turned off, defaults to on) 2. Task is due. (can be turned off for untracked tasks) 3. Regularly scheduled reminders. 4. Task is deleted. 5. Task is restored. 6. Task has changes to owner or involved. 7. Task is completed. (if it's not tracked nor overdue, we could even skip this) 8. Task is marked as not complete. From Brandon: > For the daily digest, I am envisioning a table with all of the reminders/notifications scheduled for the day (or day previous) that come through in the morning. If possible (and perhaps we can get rid of this after testing), I'd like to include a column in that table that explains why the item is included in the email (if it's not self-evident) with a link to change the setting.",

      "title": "BOLCC - Add support for Active Containment for Oil or chemical filled equipment.",
      "description": "Original title: Investigate discrepancy in secondary containment sizing for Oil or chemical filled equipment flagged by Nucor Yamato Steel Identified and sketched out in code two potential changes here on 2023-07-07, awaiting confirmation from Brandon before deploying. After conferring with Brandon, the scope of this item has changed. --- From Brandon on 2023-07-12: One of the challenges here is that secondary containment can be active or passive. The BOLCC app focuses on passive, meaning there is a structure in place to contain a spill that is adequately sized. Transformers generally rely on active containment, which means they have a spill kit nearby to respond to spills before the spill reaches a water. BOLCC requires oil and chemical filled equipment to have active secondary containment, but not passive. There’s not currently a way to document that. So I think the solution is this: 1. Add “Active containment” as a secondary containment method. 2. If active is selected, no containment calculations are required. It should work similar to a double-walled tank. 3. If OCFE is placed in a passive secondary containment, treat it the same as anything else since they are electing to rely on that instead of active. 4. In the flag for OCFE, indicate that at least active secondary containment is required. 5. As needed, you can add this description of active containment: Active containment measures are those that require deployment or other specific action by the owner or operator, such as placing a storm drain cover, using spill kits, or closing a gate valve. These measures may be deployed either before the start of an activity involving the handling of oil, or in reaction to a discharge, so long as the active measure is designed to prevent an oil spill from reaching navigable water or adjoining shorelines.",

The initial concept sketched out by Eric Hiser (Corporate dashboard concepts.docx) 2. An excel sheet showing how the ECHO compliance score is calculated (ECHO Score Example.xlsx, ECHO Score Example - Source Data 2023-04-12.png) (note this formula has changed since the original spec was written) 3. A mockup of a data grid containing the info specified in the .docx above (echo-mockups-2023-04-12.pdf) - I think we’ll need to replace some text with status icons and/or make it possible to show/hide columns. A few things to note: 1. We aren’t yet going to integrate with ECMS, that’s a longer-term idea. 2. Waste Vendor audits will be evaluated slightly, a rolling basis, from Brandon: “For waste audits, let’s do it based on the last 4 quarters.

Detailed facility report API: [https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services/detailed-facility-report](https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services/detailed-facility-report \"smartCard-inline\") --- New overall Compliance Score: - The score is #/10. - ECHO = 3.5 points - AT = 2 points - BOLCC = 1.5 points - Vendor = 1.5 points - Audit = 1.5 points - Calculation - ECHO should be calculated as it is now. Points should be assigned based on quartiles of where the facility ranks relative to its peers: - 1st Quartile = 3.5 Points - 2nd Quartile = 2.625 Points - 3rd Quartile = 1.75 Points - 4th Quartile = .875 Points - AT - 50% of the score should be yes/no based on whether they are up-to-date. - 50% of the score should be yes/no based on whether they have unresolved issues. - BOLCC - 50% of the score should be yes/no based on whether they have substantially participated. - 50% of the score should be yes/no based on whether they have any outstanding significant issues. - Vendor - 33% based on whether they are scheduled. Sliding scale (e.g., ¼ scheduled = .25 \\ \\*.33 \\* 1.5) - 67% based on whether they are completed. Sliding scale as above. - Audit - All or nothing based on whether they are up-to-date. - On the individual cards for these, let’s put how many points they’re earning from each program. --- Notes from meeting on 2023-06-26: - Make the compliance card span the top row. - Put a Horizontal stacked bar chart in the top row. - Color code it for the various components of the points. - Gray/alternate colored area showing where points are missing. - 1st row: - ECHO Score, Trend, Stats - 2nd Row: Permits, and then everything else can fall wherever. --- Notes from call on 2023-06-29: - Overall Compliance Score tweaks: - Existing ECHO portion decreases to 2.5 instead of 3.5. - ECHO points are split into 8 Octiles. - Update filter as well. - New score category to slot in the lost point: - Compliance+Permits (no exact name was given...) - 1 point if current ECHO status is Compliance AND up-to-date on permits. - 0.5 if current echo status is non-compliance AND up-to-date on permits. - 0 if significant non-compliance OR expired permits. - Might want to clarify what we do if echo is not available (could be 1 or 0 based or permits only; or could be 0.5 or 0 with proportional scaling). - Vendor Audits: - Give 0 points if no subscribed waste vendors. - Indicate no subscribed waste vendors with some sort of message on the audit cards, possibly audit table as well.",

      "description": "From Brandon: 1. We are clarifying the notes of Table 7.2B. The note under 7.2B is intended to be read as an alternative to Table 7.2B. The dashboard should apply the following logic: 1. If located in a loading area, we need to ask whether it’s practical to meet the requirements in Table 7.2B (these should be presented with the question) 1. If it is impractical, facility must provide attended transfer + active measures consistent with a 40 CFR 109.5 Plan (Oil Spill Contingency) to prevent loss of material from the facility. We can simply ask this as a yes/no. 2. If it is practical, facility must have a larger area, sufficient to contain the volumes outlined in Table 7.2B to prevent a catastrophic leak from exiting the facility. There’s a new wrinkle here because the secondary containment associated with the delivery truck may not be the same as the secondary containment for the tank itself. Rather than relying on the associated secondary containment to calculate this, I think it’s simplest to just add a question that says: “Is the delivery truck during loading or unloading parked in a larger area sufficient to contain x gallons?” This should be calculated based on Table 7.2B. --- Notes from meeting on 2023-06-23: - 7.2B is generally _not_ for the SC itself, but for a separate area that the truck/railcar uses. - So we can compute 7.2A and 7.2B separately. - We should present the computation, and then ask them for the capacity of the delivery SC. This will then feed into which question we ask them next.",

If I click edit on a primary containment and change its secondary containment by selecting something different in the secondary containment dropdown, it does not appear to update. 2. Quick(er) updates 1. On the “parameters” for primary container, let’s update the field descriptions to state primary container (e.g., “Primary Container Class”, “Primary Container Material Type”, “Primary Container Contents” 2. For secondary containment compatibility for ABCO, we need to add coated concrete as being acceptable. 3. “New” for purposes of BOLCC should now be after August 1, 2023. 3. New features 1. For generating a BMP, we now want to allow facilities to generate that without having all issues resolved. I recognize this will introduce some complexities, some of which I don’t appreciate. Let’s just plaster “Draft – See BOLCC Dashboard for Outstanding Issues” on the document.

      "description": "- User enhancements 1. The system will rely on the current Nucor.report user collection, onboarding system, and authentication procedures (code-based login that requires a Nucor or approved subsidiary domain address). 2. We will enhance the existing user collection by adding job titles and hierarchy structures to inform how escalation reporting should occur. 3. Hiser Joy would like to explore options with Nucor IT for automating the collection of some of this job title information for users. If this is not an option, we will need to establish a workflow for keeping this information up to date. As with many projects, integration with Nucor IT is preferred but often not obtainable. We can work around these issues, if needed. - Data migration 1. We will build a user interface for users to import tasks from the prior system. This will be based on the data structure from the data exports obtained during the ECMS audits. 2. We will assist with migrating data from the existing system for current users. - Task Builder 1. We will build a user interface to allow users to create new tasks and edit or delete existing tasks. These will have all existing fields and include the enhancements requested by the ECMS workgroup, such as auto-population of task assignments, assignment of multiple task IDs, and more. 2. This will also allow facilities to set task recurrence. - Task Viewer 1. We will build a user interface to allow users to sort and filter tasks based on several criteria, such as users assigned, days until due, priority, tracked status, and more. - Notifications 1. We will develop backend calculations that trigger notifications and escalation emails based on due dates, reporting hierarchy, and tracked status. - Integrations 1. Applicability Tool 1. We will leverage data from the applicability tool determinations to prompt users to add tasks that apply based on answers to determinations. 2. Users will either have to add the task or provide a reason why it is not applicable. Failure to do so will trigger a flag on the facility and corporate dashboard. In this way, the system is being audited on an ongoing basis. 3. Based on compliance issues flagged during an applicability tool determination, we can add tasks reminding users to resolve those concerns on the compliance dashboard. 2. Compliance Audits 1. The timelines for compliance audits will automatically be pulled into the ECMS as tasks. These can either be tracked or untracked, depending on preference and finding type. 3. Vendor Audits 1. When users schedule a vendor audit, these will be added as tasks on the ECMS. 2. We can also explore more aggressive approaches, such as creating tasks annually as a reminder to schedule and complete vendor audits. 4. Corporate Dashboard 1. The corporate dashboard now flags when a permit is set to expire. Related tasks can automatically be populated based on the data entered into these systems. For example, operating and construction permits with application due dates and expiration dates will sync into ECMS. 5. Standard Environmental Practices and Expectations 1. The SEPS document contains several time-sensitive expectations, such as a triennial review of hazardous waste determinations. These standard expectations could also be added as tasks as needed. 6. New Corporate Policies or Legal Guidance 1. When new corporate policies or legal guidance documents are issued, the system will allow pushing tasks to affected teammates to ensure timely review and implementation. 7. Compliance Response 1. If adverse third party compliance notices are tracked and documented within the Nucor.report environment through a future update, associated due dates can be synced into ECMS. - Standard Task Interface 1. Admin users will have access to a master list of standard task templates based on the ECMS elements memorandum. 2. These tasks and related data points can be updated at any time and prompt users to adopt changes.",

      "description": "They’d like to do some iterations with this to see if it gives us good results. I made some slight modifications to the algorithm: 1. Iterate through the vendor for each category and assign a score to each subscriber. 2. The score would be based on the following: 1. The # of audits already assigned to that facility. 2. The distance between the facility and vendor. 3. The facility group (mill, building, Vulcraft, etc.). This will be used as a surrogate for the number of resources the facility has to dedicate to this effort. 1. For example: Sheet Mills = 1; Other Mills = 2; Non-Harris and Non-Skyline = 3; Skyline = 4; Harris = 5 4. Score calculated: (# of audits + distance + group value / 100) (with appropriate weighting) 3. The facility with the lowest score is assigned to schedule the vendor. 4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all necessary audits are scheduled. I don’t think we need to worry about the UI at this point. They just want to understand how the algorithm would distribute the audits. Can you or Michael tackle this next week? Feel free to modify weighting of any of the factors to get to a result that is more evenly distributed. A spreadsheet that breaks it down would be fine or a simple UI if you think that’d be as efficient.",

For non-SPCC facilities, nothing needs to change. For SPCC facilities, the code would need to check whether the primary container is 55 gallons or greater and whether it contains an oil (diesel, gasoline, etc.).

Can we begin tracking this and making it viewable to Nucor and super admins? I’m thinking a pane that has edit history that identifies the related finding, field, date, and auditor of each edit. Let me know if you have any questions. - This is only on the report and evaluation stages. The only question we are trying to answer is whether the facility is actively engaged in responding to the report. So the ability to look at the facility’s activity in responding, understanding when responses were last logged, etc. is the goal. As a general design for this item: - I think we’ll want an activity log collection with info on each of the changes. - I think we should build in a bit of generality in the activity log schema so that if they want to track updates on Previsit or Postvisit in the future (which could include Questionnaire responses, Image uploads, File uploads, snips, etc.) it won’t be too hard. Maybe something like: ```typescript interface ActivityLogItem { logItemID: string; // \"ali_lflaqdw5_1z8idv4uxmn\" auditref: string; auditTemplateID: string; action: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete'; // For this item, 'update' is all we'll have. // Could be expanded later to include other objects: target: { type: 'finding'; findingID: string; stage: PlannerDocument['stage']; }; diff: { old: Record<string, any>; new: Record<string, any>; }; fieldsChanged: string[]; // For ease of querying/filtering. userName: string; // For ease of display. userIsLegalCounsel: boolean; // For ease of filtering (see isLegalCounsel() in widgets.html) performedBy: string; // uid performedAt: string; // ISO8601 } ```",

      "title": "Emissions - Wire up DB, integrate emissions source types, export, limits, etc.",
      "description": "Background: - Facilities need to quantify their emissions. - Manufacturing equipment generates emissions. - Potential vs. actual emissions - Potential: assume 24/7/365 operation and do the multiplication; determines regulatory applicability. - Actual: Record time and/or material actually used and do the math. - Quantifying potential emissions is easy via spreadsheet, harder with actuals. - Suppliers of paint (maybe other things too) will tweak formula without much regard for environmental impact. - VOCs in paint are a big source of emissions; VOCs carry solids onto the substrate. - VOC content can change a lot, people have a hard time tracking this. - Spreadsheets end up being a bit too complex - want to go to a web app. - Brandon has created a web app within the chemicals dashboard, and it's about 75% of the way there. Tasks: - Wire up database - Most things are facility specific - Emission unit types are NOT facility-specific. - Emission factor reference is NOT facility-specific - comes from published EPA testing data. - Products on Emissions app may sync with Products on Chemicals lookup; though some of the required fields differ. - Integrate other emission source types (tabs of existing spreadsheet; sheets are relatively self-contained) - Export potential emissions by importing into blue fields of existing workbook sheet. - While this runs some risk of de-sync, the spreadsheet will go to regulators, and those regulators want to see the Excel formulas. - Entry of limits and flagging when near/at limits - similar to FES in spirit (and maybe even in forms UI). - Workbook: Redirect to new emissions app when done. - Maybe: Rebrand chemicals app (as otherwise people will have a hard time figuring out where to go) Updates from discussion with Brandon on 2023-04-07: - Input Tab - Tell them more explicitly what to do. - They'll be filling out data monthly, generally speaking. - They'll need a configurable start date (currently we have a range hardcoded) - We'll want to flag missing data (i.e. a notice like: data hasn't been entered for X months for Y sources) - Per-unit configurable track/do not track/do not track but include PTE in actuals - Track = Current system. - Do Not Track = Configure the unit, but don't enter any data. - Do not track but include PTE in actuals = Configure the unit, don't enter actuals data, but roll up the computed PTE into our overall actuals table (useful when quantifying things for a permit for a unit whose worst-case emissions are negligible) - Add a visual flag for PTE units rolled up into Actuals. - Limits - Defer this feature! - Turn formula view into more of a table-like view w/ inputs + outputs + steps in between. - Enable formulas on PTE tab. - Spreadsheet access!

A new ECMS custom field would be available that would allow for reviewing the current environmental permits/plans/etc. uploaded for a particular facility. 2. Yearly (or however often they choose), the task will prompt them to go through each category. Users can upload new files (filling out permit expiration information if relevant), view existing files, update the information recorded for each file, and archive files that are no longer relevant. 3. Each file must be reviewed. 4. Some categories may be skipped for particular facilities based on group association. 5. Auto-schedule the task for relevant facilities. 1. Previous auto-scheduled task (KPI) ended up being manually scheduled… I’ll create a default template and we can go from there. 6. No extra Sharepoint integration at this time. 7. Implement as a standalone tool that can be integrated into ECMS and AppTool. It will likely live in ECMS. 8. Renewed permits don’t need to be reviewed. 1. Renewed permits can even be archived automatically. --- _Notes on old direction:_ Note to self, see: `2023-07-18-filees-fes-apptool-integration-notes.txt` After a 2024-04-05 conversation with Brandon, this may change scope/focus: - Permit files may be managed entirely by a new type of ECMS task template. - Users would choose audit file categories and set up recurring tasks to review (and possibly upload) these permits. - This might involve interacting with some facility or group specific Sharepoint instances (or folders? it’s unclear how separate they are). - It’s currently unclear if we’ll need to linking between the two Sharepoint locations, or if we’ll just upload files to both places. - This is all waiting on hearing back from a Nucor management comittee.",

But we aren't necessarily tracking all the necessary data to determine if the oil being stored is all applicable to SPCC, so a facility could appear to meet the capacity requirements, but instead be storing a bunch of benign stuff. We should: - Explain what being an SPCC site means at a high-level, and what the effect on BOLCC is (in short: there are laws to adhere to and the BOLCC requirements are more strict for SPCC sites) - Facilities indicate whether they are an SPCC site on the Applicability Tool. We should pull this in automatically if available. - Do a naïve roll-up of the capacity requirements and present an indication that they likely are or are not an SPCC site. - Ultimately the user at the facility makes the SPCC or not determination via a setting on the Facility's settings page (but we may auto-set an initial value or strongly suggest a specific value)",

I'll do a review of places that are processing the master list, and will add filtering where relevant for example: - If vendor audits is complaining about inactive facilities, I'll make it stop. - Planner can stop showing inactive facilities when creating new audits. 3.

A related question, is the large/small designation based on tonnage per year, excluding those already audited in the cycle? It should be that way because many mills have less than 12 suppliers providing the top 67%.

Unfortunately, I can't reliably reproduce it, but it happens every audit sporadically. You may have to add images and doctor up a presentation to get it to do its thing. It seems to happen more as the file gets more data. Typically refreshing the page fixes it. Safety is going to start using the system and I suspect they may not be as patient.

This would be an exportable document that presents the tank information and the applicable obligations from the SEPS document. --- - BMP plan and Chris's requirements plan are basically the same thing. - In general, the thrust of the plan should be towards: - Actionable compliance items for the containment from the BOLCC SEP. - Any relevant requirements BOLCC specifies. - Written from the perspective that these are applied correctly (i.e. if they are out of compliance, we can flag this elsewhere). - With section references listed throughout. - For example, we might list that a risk assessment is required, and what the target score is, but we don't need to list all the questions/dimensions that the risk assessment relies on. - Another example, if 3 overfill protections are required, but 7 are implemented, this report only needs to list the 3 required ones. - ~~Issues can be listed separately, in a separate section near the bottom or something. Probably accompanied with a note like \"above specifications assume compliance with BOLCC; the BOLCC system has identified some areas that are not in compliance: <issues list> <assessments list>\"~~ We’re going to prevent generation of the BMP plan if issues are present. - In general, it seems like the approach is for something to be easily digestible to someone who might be interested in the high-level details of what compliance looks like for a particular containment. ‌",

Basically, the secondary containment needs to be just as compatible as the primary containment with the contents since it may be called upon to hold the same material in the event of a release. - I think we can ask what the secondary containment material is using the options in the “permissible container types” column of table 5.1. Based on the contents stored in the secondary containment, we should be able to assess compatibility. - The sufficiently impermeable aspect is from 40 CFR 112.8(c)(2). I think we can simply do this as a yes/no. Something like: “Is the secondary containment sufficiently impervious to contain discharged material until spill response can occur?” - Spill radius calculations, if applicable - Location (Inside, Open Structure, Outside, Non-Containers: Sumps, Vaults and Impoundments) (see Section 7.2) - We need to know which table applies, 7.2a, 7.2b, or 7.2c, so we’ll need to ask whether it is a container management area, a loading/unloading area, or a nonroutine loading/unloading area. Also add container delivery and impractical to capture the options from 7.2a, 7.2b. These options should probably cascade based on which table applies. - 25 year, 24 hour storm volume (should be stored at the facility level; maybe not listed here) - Type (see Section 7.3) - Primary containments (optional, can be added later)",

      "description": "Initial conditions I can think of: - Stage == X - Stage != X Any others? We will likely need some sort of toggle on whether the condition merely delays the email or is part of the condition. For example: 1. An email to be sent 30 days after the end of an audit, when that audit is in the Completed stage - the intention here is likely that the email should be sent no matter what, but only after everything has been wrapped up. 2. An email to be sent 45 days after the report is issued, if we’re still in the Report Issued stage - this is likely meant as a reminder to the facility to respond to the findings, and thus should _not_ be sent later on. For #1 above, `notificationProduce_` will need to change so that an email will be sent once a condition becomes true. Currently each notification has 1 date on which it may be sent, and this is no longer true. \\#2 above should be a simple extra if statement to the existing code that processes whether or not a notification should be sent.",

The function is createWB(). From Brandon (2022-07-29): Can you look into this at your next convenience? This is that issue where it works on the apps script deployment but not wb.nucor.report. I think it's a timeout issue. I am guessing there's some time limitation on the apps script api execution?

The corporate page will be limited by branch access, but at the facility level any type of applicability determination can be initiated. 2. When viewing a facilities list of determinations, it should have a dropdown that filters by branch, defaulting to either safety or environmental depending on your branch access as a user (but that toggle could be flipped). 3. Users are associated with either a safety or environmental branch, which will determine what they have access to in the questionnaire builder. But there is an additional layer!

      "title": "BOLCC dashboard - Estimate, plan development items, sketch out general flow of the app (want this by end of 2nd quarter)",
      "description": "## Here is what we need the BOLCC dashboard to do: - Tank Inventory: The dashboard will collect all tank information necessary to assess the applicability of various BOLCC requirements. - Secondary containment inventory and association: The dashboard will collect all secondary containment specifications and allow facilities to assign one or more tanks to a particular secondary containment area. - Secondary containment capacity calculation: Based on the associated tanks volume and other specifications, the dashboard will calculate whether secondary containment capacity is adequate for the assigned tanks or whether the spill radius alternative is available. - Risk Assessment: Based on the tank and secondary containment inventory, the dashboard will complete the risk assessment for the given tanks, including calculation of the controlled score and indicators as to whether the tank meets the BOLCC’s controlled score target. - Primary Containment Assessment: The dashboard will collect data on the contents of the tank and evaluate whether the primary containment meets Table 5.1 and section 5.2 of the BOLCC guidance. - Periodic Visual and Integrity Assessments. The dashboard will identify the assessments required. Depending on the level of information requested, we can set this up to require data entry documenting the results of certain assessments. Alternatively, we can require users to indicate the assessments have been completed. If the completion of these assessments are documented in the dashboard in any way, we can include reminders for upcoming assessments. - Overfill protection. Based on the size of the tank and other factors, the dashboard will indicate whether overfill protection is required. Based on the nature of transfer operations, the dashboard will indicate what type of overfill protection is required. - Periodic Inspection Frequency. The dashboard will determine the required inspection frequency based on Table 7.5.2. - Secondary Containment Instrumentation. The dashboard will determine the secondary containment instrumentation required, if any, for tanks and containers. - Inspection Forms. The dashboard will house the inspection forms and generate them dynamically for particular tanks and tank installations. - Corporate and Facility Views. The dashboard will include a facility view, which allows management of facility-level information, as well as a corporate-level view, which will allow the corporate environmental team to oversee compliance with BOLCC guidance. --- ## Some other notes on the system: - Web forms. - Fresh start (mostly; proccesses already exist to comply with government regulations, but this is an expanded process/system being built under Nucor's own initiative) - Consultants brought in and created recommendations for spill prevention. - SEPs - Standard Environmental Practices. - These guidelines/processes will be more stringent than federally mandated SPCCs. - Periodic Visual and Integrity Assessments - Nucor folks haven't quite decided how much babysitting they wait to do. Possible solution is: - Provide reminders for actions repeating within 1 year. - Require input for items that happen on timescales >= 1 year. - Nucor is decentralized/facilities are wary of corporate babysitting. - Each facility has their own individual SPCC plan. - Feds put out guidance. - Professional engineers are brought in to assess the state of things. - While this has achieved federal compliance, from a risk-management perspective, nucor wants to do more. - SPCC plans (plus some others) have existing layouts/inventories. - Trust but verify the facilities input (verification/auditing will happen at a later date) - 150ish facilities vs. 7 corporate environmental people. - The environmental people act more as resources rather than overseers. - Budget is roughly 220 hours of my time, or around $25,000. - Getting this done towards the end of the second quarter is the goal here (aka end of June). - Facilities have tanks -> tanks have containment structures -> facilities will use this tool to manage risk appropriately. - Brandon is playing catch-up on this stuff as well, he says he's not too far ahead of me on understanding how the system should work :) - Don't worry too much about estimates/implementation right now - Wait for it to become a priority. --- ## Primary Screens - Tank Add/Edit Screen (see Section 8.1) - Unique identifier - Manufacturer (if known) - Date installed (or presumed installed) - Container material type (see Table 5.1) - Container type (tote, drum, tank, sump, vault, impoundment; see Table 5.1) - Contents chemical type (see Sections 2.2, 2.3, and Table 5.1) - Capacity (in gallons) - Dimensions - Release protection provided (see Appendix D - Nucor Tank/Vault/Impoundment Record) - Overfill protection provided. - (Maybe) Ask for confirmation that the standards listed in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 have been adhered to. - Secondary containment (optional, can be added later or may not be required at all) - Secondary Containment Add/Edit Screen (see Section 8.2) - Unique identifier - Date installed (or presumed installed) - Capacity (gallons, see Section 7.2; we may be able to/need to take in dimensions and calculate displacement of primary containments to determine true capacity) - Demonstration of compatibility with contents/sufficiently impermeable under SPCC (not 100% sure what this is? A yes/no? A longform description?) - Spill radius calculations, if applicable - Location (Inside, Open Structure, Outside, Non-Containers: Sumps, Vaults and Impoundments) (see Section 7.2) - 25 year, 24 hour storm volume (should this be stored at the facility level?) - Type (see Section 7.3) - Primary containments (optional, can be added later) - Facility Details - Tank & Secondary Containment Inventory - Lists all tanks and secondary containments facilities have added to the system. - Tanks in the same secondary containment are grouped together. - IDs, capacity, age, and controlled+uncontrolled risk scores (if applicable) are displayed. - Target controlled risk score is: 4 or less for tanks < 5000 gallons, 5 or less for tanks 5000 gallons to 30,000 gallons, and 7 or less for tanks larger than 30,000 gallons (see Section 4.3) - Calculations - Should be implemented standalone for use on any page, may be cached in the database for easy/fast retrieval by other parts of the system: - If risk assessments are required (Section 4.1 and 4.2): - Each container management area holding more than 500 gallons of an oil or liquid chemical. The form should be completed for the largest container capacity using the worst case material managed in the area. Individual containers in a container management area do not require evaluation. - Each outdoor bulk container 110 gallons or larger used for storing an oil or liquid chemical. - Any tank, vault, or impoundment of 500 gallons or more used for primary storage of an oil, liquid chemical, or other covered liquid. - Any oil or chemical filled equipment containing 500 gallons or more of an oil or liquid chemical. - Whether secondary containment is for the given tanks is: - Required: Section 7.1 - Adequate: Section 7.2 - Spill Radius Alternative is available: indoor, <500 gallons only, Section 7.4 - Whether the tank/primary containment meets \"containments and contents compatibility\" guidelines in Table 5.1 - Whether the tank/primary containment meets Section 5.2 primary containment standards - Whether overfill protection is required, and if so what type (see Section 6.1.2) - What secondary containment instrumentation is required, if any (see Section 7.6) - Identifies which integrity assessments apply, and how often (see Section 5.4, Section 6.1.4, Section 7.5 and forms in Appendix D) - Inspection dynamic forms (Appendix D) - link to these from details screen, pre-fill with relevant tank information, some/all of these will likely be best implemented as mobile-friendly web forms, but a paper form and a simple \"I did it\" toggle could make sense in some circumstances: - (likely not needed, covered by tank add/edit screen) Nucor Tank/Vault/Impoundment Record - (likely not needed, covered by secondary containment add/edit screen) Nucor Secondary Containment/Container Management Area Record - Nucor Bulk Containment Risk Assessment (also listed in Section 4.2) - Nucor Annual Tank/Secondary Containment Inspection - Nucor Secondary Containment - Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly Inspection/Leak Detection - Inspection forms/references - Static forms - make available for download. - Appendices A through C - Section 6.2 - Section 6.4 - Facility High-Level - Condensed view of Facility Details, only listing: - Anything the system flags as risky or out of compliance. - If nothing is risky or out of compliance, list the top 5 tanks with the highest \"uncontrolled risk\" score. - Dates of upcoming inspections. - Corporate View - Lists any facilities with storage that is risky or out of compliance, or behind on inspections.",

      "description": "- Integrate information from various portals. - High-level corporate users want to be able to pull up nucor.report and see the status of various programs. - Main audience is executive vice president sort of person. - General idea is to answer the question for them: \"Is there any high-level stuff to worry about? Any existential threats to the business at any of our facilities?\" - Top-level is a list of facilities that can be drilled own into. - Users are obsessed with color-coding things. - Likely colors are red/yellow/green/blue. - High-level questions to answer: - Are all permits up-to-date? (will collect expiration dates on permit files) - What's their score from most recent corporate environmental questionnaire? - Maybe other things TBD. - Drill down tinto the facility to see: - Applicability tool - Has it been completed/are we within the deadline? - Are there any compliance issues flagged? - Vendor audits - Code a value for % completion (i.e. all undone in January is fine, 50% done in June is probably fine, but 10% done in October is bad) - FES - Corporate environment audits - Are they on time in their responses? (hold off on safety for now) - FES - Uploaded permits may be expiring - Required files needs a blessed “expiration” field that we can read. - Users need to be able to mark expired permits as: - \"Application submitted\" (aka we're on it: a new permit is on the way) - New permit issued\" (aka this expired permit has been supplanted) - BOLCC indicator of some kind (start with red rollup number from Risks page) - PAE tool - projected actual emissions. (this is dead at the moment) - 3 levels: - 1st level - Any existential threats. - 2nd level - Summary of portals. - 3rd level - What data the above two levels are based on. ‌",

I fixed this on ECMS project, but not facility audits project. This will require adding data-docid and data-created attributes to the findingrowinputs, among other things. Let me know if you have any Qs. - When adding a new user on the planner page, it duplicates any users that are already in the select2 component. - When adding a new user, these don’t get populated to the assignment select2 options. - In updating the move function on file page, I was a bit out of my depth given my lack of vuejs experience. Can you check my work? - On the planner page, when clicking edit, the assignments do not consistently populate. Errs every few times. - On the planner page, when clicking edit, the auditors input keeps duplicating auditors. To recreate this, edit one. Close it. Then edit a different one. It will have both the original and subsequent auditors in the input.",

      "description": "- Audit Types Listing - This will likely be a new page that will serve as a jumping off point into managing/editing types of audits. - Users who have permission to plan audits will be able to see a listing of audit types that are available to them. - Audit types specific to a facility will be editable by a facility admin. - Audit types defined at the group or company level will likely be visible, but not editable by a facility admin. However, a facility admin can create a copy of it for their facility and edit that! - Audit types that are currently in-use will require special consideration. I haven't fully decided here, but I'm thinking the audit type definitions should always remain separate from their point-of-use. That way templates can be updated without worrying about breaking past or present audits. Additionally, that will allow specific audits to have one-time tweaks without affecting the general template. - From Brandon: I am a little torn on this. I think your approach makes sense. My only hesitation is that changes to the template that are intended to be global and affect existing audits may arise. But we can worry about that use case if and when it happens. - Audit Type Editor/Checklist Editor - This will be a revised and expanded version of the current checklist editor. - Audit types will have an editable name and description. - Finding types will be available for creation, deletion, editing, and re-ordering. - Program areas will be available for creation, deletion, editing, and re-ordering. - Standards will be available for creation, deletion, editing, and re-ordering. - Since we expect templates to be edited by group or facility admins, there will not be multiple textareas for each group, as only 1 group will be relevant. (though if needed, we could make the groups appear for admins who create templates available at the company level) - From Brandon: I like this idea. Let’s allow group level guidance for users at the company level. - If a user is a group, company, or super admin, they may make the template available at those higher levels, rather than at the facility level. This will have the effect of making it visible to lower-level admins, though those lower-level admins will only be able to edit it by creating a copy. - Planner - As new Audit Types are defined, they will appear in the \"Audit Type\" dropdown on the planner. - Previsit/Postvisit - Finding types, program areas, and standards defined on the audit type template will populate the various dropdowns and the checklist. - From Brandon: Assuming the data structure stays the same, this part should be baked in already. I’ll handle tying this in. If we expect data structure to change, let me know.",
